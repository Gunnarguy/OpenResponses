• Built-in compatibility guidance so every model and tool combination stays within OpenAI and App Store policies
• Save, organize, and reuse prompt setups across projects with the Prompt Library

BUILT FOR APPLE
• SwiftUI interface optimized for iPhone with buttery smooth animations

• User-in-the-loop approvals for computer-use and sensitive actions to satisfy Apple's 2025 generative AI disclosure guidance

PRIVACY FIRST
• Your API keys stay on-device in the Keychain
• No analytics, no tracking, no accounts—ever
• All conversations and configuration data remain local unless you export them
• Safety notices in onboarding and the chat composer remind you that AI output can be inaccurate and to keep sensitive information out of prompts

AI-generated output can be inaccurate or outdated—always review critical information before acting.

2. Open Settings > Model and select "GPT-5" or "GPT-4.1".
3. Send "Summarize the WWDC 2025 keynote" to verify streaming responses.
4. Enable Code Interpreter under Settings > Tools and run "Plot the first 12 Fibonacci numbers."
5. Attach a PDF from the Files picker and ask "Summarize the attached document."
6. (Optional) Open Settings > MCP > Connector Gallery and connect an MCP server you control to verify tool calls. MCP is not required for review.
