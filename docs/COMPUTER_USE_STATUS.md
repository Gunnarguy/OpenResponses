# Computer Use - Current Status & Implementation Guide

**Last Updated:** September 13, 2025  
**Status:** üéâ **PRODUCTION READY** - Feature Complete with Enhanced Reliability  
**Model Support:** `computer-use-preview` only

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

The Computer Use tool is **100% feature complete** and production ready. All OpenAI computer actions are implemented with comprehensive error handling, enhanced click reliability for modern JavaScript-heavy sites, intelligent confirmation policies, and robust streaming resilience. The system has evolved from basic functionality to a sophisticated, bulletproof implementation ready for real-world usage.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **`ComputerService.swift`** - Native iOS computer action executor
2. **`ChatViewModel.swift`** - Computer use orchestration and lifecycle management
3. **`OpenAIService.swift`** - API integration and tool configuration
4. **`APICapabilities.swift`** - Computer tool configuration and encoding

### Key Design Patterns

- **Off-screen WebView** - Attached to key window at low alpha for reliable rendering
- **Defensive Programming** - Graceful handling of unknown actions prevents crashes
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - Prevents infinite loops and excessive wait operations
- **Multi-Strategy Execution** - Enhanced click implementation with fallback mechanisms
- **One-Shot Auto-Retry** - Transient error recovery with preserved context

## üéâ What's Working (Production Ready Features)

### ‚úÖ Complete Action Support

- **Navigation**: `navigate` - URL navigation with scheme validation
- **Visual**: `screenshot` - Off-screen WebView capture with DOM readiness
- **Interaction**: `click`, `double_click` - Enhanced multi-strategy implementation
- **Input**: `type` - Text input into focused elements
- **Keyboard**: `keypress` - Supports arrays of key combinations
- **Mouse**: `move` - Hover simulation with mouseover events
- **Layout**: `scroll` - Smooth scrolling with configurable direction/distance
- **Timing**: `wait` - Configurable duration with circuit breaker (max 3 consecutive)
- **Complex**: `drag` - Path-based dragging with coordinate arrays
- **Fallback**: Unknown actions handled gracefully with screenshots

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Reliability Features

- **Multi-Strategy Clicks**: Focus ‚Üí Mouse Events ‚Üí Direct Click ‚Üí Handler Triggering
- **Navigate-First Enforcement**: Prevents screenshot-first loops with mandatory navigation
- **JavaScript Framework Support**: Enhanced event bubbling for React/Vue applications
- **Dynamic Content Detection**: Extended wait times for click-triggered content changes
- **Detailed Action Logging**: Comprehensive feedback about what was clicked and results
- **Intent-Aware Search Typing**: When the user says ‚Äúsearch/find/type in X,‚Äù the app will type and submit that query directly in Google/Bing before continuing. This reduces wrong turns from clicking suggestion chips and ensures the exact requested query is honored.

### ‚úÖ Production Hardening

- **Streaming Auto-Retry**: One-shot retry for transient `model_error`/`response.failed`
- **Loop Prevention**: Help page for misuse, consecutive wait limits, first-action override
- **404 Mitigation**: Uses streaming `call_id`/`action` with `store: true`, GET fallback only
- **Smart Confirmation Policy**: No unnecessary prompts for benign actions (Learn More, Get Started, etc.)
- **Visual Fidelity**: Solid, non-faded WebView screenshots via proper window attachment
- **Conversation Continuity**: Multi-website navigation via `previous_response_id` threading

### ‚úÖ User Experience

- **Status Chips**: "üñ•Ô∏è Using computer..." during active operations
- **Real-time Screenshots**: Live visual feedback in chat interface
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallbacks with user-friendly messages
- **Settings Integration**: Model compatibility checks and UI toggles
- **Analytics Integration**: Comprehensive logging and event tracking

## üöß Known Limitations & Workarounds

### Model Restrictions

- **Limited to `computer-use-preview` model only**
- Disabled for: `gpt-5`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4`, `o3` series
- **Workaround**: Clear model compatibility messaging in settings

### Platform Constraints

- **iOS/Browser environment only** - No native macOS computer control
- **WebView-based** - Limited to web content, cannot control native iOS apps
- **Network dependent** - Requires active internet for both model and web content

### JavaScript-Heavy Sites

- **Some buttons still may not respond** despite enhanced click implementation
- **Dynamic content timing** - Some sites may need longer wait periods
- **Workaround**: Manual retry or alternative interaction approaches

## üîß Implementation Details

### Enhanced Click Implementation

The click system now uses a sophisticated multi-strategy approach:

```javascript
// Strategy 1: Element focus
if (el.focus) el.focus();

// Strategy 2: Complete mouse event sequence
["mousedown", "mouseup", "click"].forEach(function (eventType) {
  var event = new MouseEvent(eventType, {
    bubbles: true,
    cancelable: true,
    view: window,
    clientX: x,
    clientY: y,
    button: 0,
    buttons: eventType === "mousedown" ? 1 : 0,
  });
  el.dispatchEvent(event);
});

// Strategy 3: Direct click fallback
if (el.click) el.click();

// Strategy 4: Handler triggering for buttons/links
if (el.onclick) el.onclick.call(el);
```

Additionally, a conservative, site-agnostic guardrail improves precision for ambiguous "hamburger/menu" requests near the top-left corner on mobile layouts:

- If a click target is within ~80x80 CSS px from the top-left, the executor first attempts to resolve a visible, icon-sized, button-like element (aria-label/title includes "menu"/"hamburger" or empty inner text) and clicks its center instead of generic containers.
- If no such control is visible, the assistant should respond "I cannot find the hamburger menu" rather than guessing. This aligns with the strict non-guessing instruction policy.

### Confirmation Policy System

Smart prompting reduces friction while maintaining safety:

**No Confirmation Needed:**

- Navigate to requested URLs
- Click benign buttons: "Learn more", "Get started", "Next", pagination
- Open "Sign in" pages (never enters credentials)
- Scrolling, opening menus, taking screenshots

**Confirmation Required:**

- Purchases/checkout processes
- Subscriptions or account changes
- Posting/deleting content
- Submitting forms with personal data
- Downloading/executing files
- Entering credentials

### Streaming Resilience

Auto-retry system handles transient failures:

- **One-shot retry** with ~800ms backoff
- **Preserves context**: base `previous_response_id`, user text, attachments
- **Avoids UI flicker**: Guards standard cleanup during retry
- **Prevents spam**: Single retry attempt only

## üö¶ Current Status: Ready to Move On

The Computer Use implementation has reached a mature, production-ready state. Key achievements:

‚úÖ **Feature Complete** - All actions implemented with error handling  
‚úÖ **Production Hardened** - Enhanced reliability and user experience  
‚úÖ **Thoroughly Tested** - Comprehensive validation checklist passed  
‚úÖ **Well Documented** - Implementation guide and testing procedures  
‚úÖ **Future Proof** - Defensive programming prevents breaking changes

**Recommendation**: The Computer Use tool is stable and ready for production use. Development effort can now focus on other app features while maintaining the current implementation. Any future enhancements should be driven by specific user feedback rather than preemptive development.
