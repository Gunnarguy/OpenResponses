**[2025-09-13] Beta Pause Note:**
This project is paused in a "super beta" state. Major recent work includes:

- Ultra-strict computer-use mode (toggle disables all app-side helpers; see Advanced.md)
- Full production-ready computer-use tool (all official actions, robust error handling, native iOS WebView)
- Model/tool compatibility gating: computer-use is only available on the dedicated model (`computer-use-preview`), not gpt-4o/gpt-4-turbo/etc.
- All changes are documented for easy resumption‚Äîsee ROADMAP.md and CASE_STUDY.md for technical details.

- [x] **Screenshot Capture**: Confirmed screenshots capture actual webpage content instead of blank/white screens
- [x] **UI Integration**: Verified screenshots display correctly in chat interface with proper sizing
- [x] **Status Chips**: Confirmed "üñ•Ô∏è Using computer..." status displays during active tool calls
- [x] **Navigation**: Tested successful navigation to URLs (e.g., Google.com)
- [x] **DOM Readiness**: Verified DOM ready checks complete successfully before screenshots
- [x] **Click Reliability**: Enhanced click implementation with multiple strategies (focus, mouse events, direct click, handler triggering) for JavaScript-heavy sites like Netflix, with detailed feedback logging

**Advanced Features Testing**
