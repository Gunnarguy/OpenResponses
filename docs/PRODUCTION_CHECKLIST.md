# Production Checklist for OpenResponses

---

**[2025-09-13] Beta Pause Note:**
This project is paused in a "super beta" state. Major recent work includes:

- Ultra-strict computer-use mode (toggle disables all app-side helpers; see Advanced.md)
- Full production-ready computer-use tool (all official actions, robust error handling, native iOS WebView)
- Model/tool compatibility gating: computer-use is only available on the dedicated model (`computer-use-preview`), not gpt-4o/gpt-4-turbo/etc.
- All changes are documented for easy resumption‚Äîsee ROADMAP.md and CASE_STUDY.md for technical details.

**To resume:** Review this section, ROADMAP.md, and the case study for a full summary of what‚Äôs done and what‚Äôs next.

This checklist covers all essential aspects for App Store submission, organized by the 5-phase roadmap defined in `ROADMAP.md`.

Refer to `ROADMAP.md` for detailed implementation requirements and priority order.

## Platform Compatibility

## Testing

### Computer Use Tool Production Testing

üéâ **PRODUCTION-READY STATUS**: All critical computer use functionality has been validated and is working correctly.

**Core Functionality Testing**

- [x] **WebView Initialization**: Verified proper frame initialization (440x956) during WebView creation
- [x] **Screenshot Capture**: Confirmed screenshots capture actual webpage content instead of blank/white screens
- [x] **UI Integration**: Verified screenshots display correctly in chat interface with proper sizing
- [x] **Status Chips**: Confirmed "üñ•Ô∏è Using computer..." status displays during active tool calls
- [x] **Navigation**: Tested successful navigation to URLs (e.g., Google.com)
- [x] **DOM Readiness**: Verified DOM ready checks complete successfully before screenshots
- [x] **Click Reliability**: Enhanced click implementation with multiple strategies (focus, mouse events, direct click, handler triggering) for JavaScript-heavy sites like Netflix, with detailed feedback logging

**Advanced Features Testing**

- [x] **Single-Shot Mode**: Confirmed screenshot-only requests ("Show me a screenshot of Google.com") complete without infinite loops
- [x] **URL Detection**: Verified automatic URL extraction from user messages for screenshot actions
- [x] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and fallback mechanisms tested
- [x] **API Compliance**: Verified proper `current_url` parameter inclusion and safety check handling
- [x] **Safety Approval Sheet**: When `pending_safety_checks` are returned, the app shows a sheet summarizing the action and checks; approving proceeds and sends `acknowledged_safety_checks`, canceling aborts and clears `previous_response_id`.

**Error Prevention Testing**

- [x] **Preflight System**: Test that `resolvePendingComputerCallsIfNeeded()` correctly detects pending computer calls in previous responses
- [x] **Chain Breaking**: Verify that `lastResponseId` is cleared when pending computer calls are found
- [x] **Error Prevention**: Confirm that messages can be sent after computer calls without 400 "No tool output found" errors
- [x] **Logging**: Check that comprehensive debug logs are generated for preflight operations
- [x] **Model Compatibility**: Ensure preflight only runs for computer-use-preview model
- [x] **Transparent Operation**: Verify that users don't need to manually handle pending computer call states

**Performance & Stability Testing**
