2. **Select Model**: Choose `computer-use-preview`
3. **Test Basic Functionality**: Ask the assistant to take a screenshot or visit a website (e.g., "Show me a screenshot of Google.com")
4. **Visual Check**: You should see a green-tinted container with a blue border and a caption like "Screenshot (WxH)" around the image. This debug styling confirms the image view has a concrete layout size and is rendering.
5. **Monitor Status**: Watch for status chips showing "Navigating", "Taking screenshot", etc.
6. **Check Debug Logs**: Enable verbose logging to see detailed operation logs

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### WebView Not Loading

1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify the URL is accessible
3. Check for content blockers or restrictions
4. Monitor AppLogger for WebView errors

### Screenshots Show Blank/White Canvas

Most cases are resolved by proper WebView frame initialization. If you still see a blank area where the image should be:

1. Confirm you can see the green background and blue border around the image area. If not visible, the SwiftUI layout may have given the image zero width.
2. We now pin a concrete width in `EnhancedImageView` and preserve aspect ratio using `GeometryReader` and `.frame(width: maxDisplayWidth)` to prevent zero-sized layouts.
3. Check console for logs like:
   - `🖼️ [MessageBubbleView] Displaying 1 images ...`
   - `🖼️ [EnhancedImageView] Rendering image: size=(..., ...)`
   - `🖼️ [EnhancedImageView] container size: (w, h)`
4. Ensure DOM is ready before screenshots (you should see `DOM is ready! Requesting animation frames...`).
5. Verify the content isn't behind authentication.

### Computer Use Actions Not Executing

1. Verify computer use is enabled in settings
2. Check that you're using a compatible model (gpt-4o)
3. Monitor streaming status for error messages
4. Check AppLogger for detailed error information

### Performance Issues

1. **Memory**: Computer use automatically cleans up WebView resources
2. **Battery**: Operations are optimized for mobile efficiency
3. **Network**: Only necessary data is transmitted to OpenAI

## 📈 Performance Tips
