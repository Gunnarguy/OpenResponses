**[2025-09-20] Architecture Refresh Note:**
Recent cleanup work modernized the codebase layout to better support feature teams and AI agents:

- Migrated the monolithic `OpenResponses` folder into purpose-driven groups (`App`, `Core`, `Features`, `Shared`, `Resources`, `Support`) that align with MVVM boundaries and reduce Xcode project clutter.
- Split the streaming pipeline out of `ChatViewModel.swift` into a focused `ChatViewModel+Streaming.swift` extension, making each handler short, documented, and easier to evolve for new `StreamingEvent` types.
- Refactored `OpenAIService.swift` request construction into smaller helper methods so future Conversations API work can reuse the same composable builders for tools, attachments, and metadata.

This structural refresh preserves existing functionality while making it simpler to reason about responsibilities, onboard contributors, and satisfy the roadmap's upcoming Conversations API migration.

**[2025-09-13] Beta Pause Note:**
This project is paused in a "super beta" state. Major recent work includes:

- Ultra-strict computer-use mode (toggle disables all app-side helpers; see Advanced.md)
- Full production-ready computer-use tool (all official actions, robust error handling, native iOS WebView)
- Model/tool compatibility gating: computer-use is only available on the dedicated model (`computer-use-preview`), not gpt-4o/gpt-4-turbo/etc.
- All changes are documented for easy resumption—see ROADMAP.md and Full_API_Reference.md for technical details.

**To resume:** Review this section, ROADMAP.md, and the API reference for a full summary of what’s done and what’s next.

## Abstract

OpenResponses is a native SwiftUI application for iOS and macOS, conceived as a power-user's gateway to the full capabilities of the OpenAI API. While appearing as a simple chat interface, it is a sophisticated tool designed for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who require granular control over model interactions.

**Vision**: OpenResponses has successfully completed Phase 1 of its mission to achieve **100% compliance** with the latest OpenAI and Apple capabilities. Now at ~75% API coverage with all core features implemented, the app has evolved from its solid foundation into a comprehensive multimodal AI platform with production-ready tool capabilities and performance optimizations.

This case study explores the architectural decisions, technical challenges, and implementation details that make OpenResponses a robust and flexible platform for exploring advanced AI. For a complete list of project documentation, please see the main [README](/README.md#additional-documentation).

### 1. The Problem: Beyond the Playground

The standard web-based chat interfaces for large language models, while user-friendly, often obscure the powerful features available through the API. Parameters like `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, tool selection, and especially the new `reasoning_effort` for o-series models are either hidden or unavailable.

The primary motivation behind OpenResponses was to create a native, high-performance "pro" tool that:

- Exposes the full, granular control of the OpenAI API.
- Provides a seamless interface for managing complex features like File Search, Vector Stores, and Code Interpretation.
- Acts as a reliable testbed for experimenting with different models and settings in a persistent, session-based environment.
- Is itself a subject for AI-driven development, with a codebase clean and clear enough for an AI agent to understand and modify.

### 2. Core Architectural Decisions

The project's foundation is built on modern, maintainable patterns to manage its inherent complexity.

#### Why SwiftUI and MVVM?

- **SwiftUI**: Chosen for its declarative syntax, cross-platform (iOS/macOS) capabilities, and tight integration with the Apple ecosystem. It allows for a clean, responsive UI with less boilerplate code.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: This pattern was critical for separating concerns.
  - **View**: (`ChatView`, `SettingsView`, etc.) Purely responsible for displaying data and capturing user input. They are lightweight and reactive.
  - **ViewModel**: (`ChatViewModel`) The central nervous system of the app. It holds the application's state (like the message list), contains the business logic for handling user actions, and orchestrates calls to the network layer. Its use of `@Published` properties allows the UI to update automatically.
  - **Model**: (`ChatMessage`, `OpenAIResponse`, etc.) Simple, `Codable` data structures that precisely mirror the API's JSON, ensuring reliable data transfer.

#### `UserDefaults` as the Control Panel

For an application with dozens of configurable settings, a simple and persistent state management solution was essential. `@AppStorage` provides a direct, two-way binding between UI controls (like `Toggle` and `Picker`) and `UserDefaults`.

This choice dramatically simplified the settings implementation. The `OpenAIService` can read directly from `UserDefaults` when constructing API calls, ensuring that every request is perfectly tailored to the user's latest configuration without passing settings objects all over the application.

#### Type-Safe API Architecture with `APICapabilities.swift`

A significant architectural decision was the introduction of `APICapabilities.swift` as a centralized, type-safe blueprint for all OpenAI API features. This single source of truth approach provides several benefits:

- **Compile-Time Validation**: Swift enums with associated values ensure that tool configurations match the exact API schema, preventing runtime errors from malformed requests.
- **Documentation as Code**: Rather than maintaining separate documentation that can become outdated, the API capabilities are defined directly in Swift with comprehensive DocC comments.
- **Consistency Enforcement**: All components (networking layer, compatibility service, UI) use the same typed definitions, eliminating discrepancies between different parts of the codebase.
- **Maintainability**: When the OpenAI API evolves, changes need only be made in one place, and the type system ensures all dependent code is updated accordingly.

The `Tool` enum structure directly mirrors the API's expected JSON format, making the translation from Swift types to network requests seamless and reliable.

### 3. Deep Dive: Tackling Complexity

The true robustness of OpenResponses is evident in how it handles the API's most advanced features.

#### A. Dual-Mode API Communication: Streaming vs. Non-Streaming

The OpenAI API can respond in two ways: as a complete, single block of data, or as a real-time stream of events. Supporting both required a dual-path approach:

1. **`ChatViewModel` Logic**: A simple `Bool` from `UserDefaults` determines which path to take.
2. **`OpenAIService` Methods**:
    - `sendChatRequest(...)`: Uses a standard `async/await` `URLSession.shared.data(for:)` call. It returns a single, complete `OpenAIResponse` object.
    - `streamChatRequest(...)`: Uses `URLSession.shared.bytes(for:)` to get an `AsyncThrowingStream` of data. It parses Server-Sent Events (SSE) line-by-line, decodes each into a `StreamingEvent` struct, and `yield`s it to the caller.
3. **UI/UX Handling**:
    - In non-streaming mode, the UI waits for the final response.

- In streaming mode, the `ChatViewModel` first appends a blank assistant message. As text deltas arrive, it appends the text to this message, creating the "typing" effect. To reduce UI churn, a lightweight text coalescer buffers rapid-fire deltas and flushes on sentence boundaries or a short debounce. The `StreamingStatusView` is updated based on events like `response.connecting` or `response.in_progress` to give the user clear feedback.

#### B. Dynamic Tool and Parameter Construction

The `OpenAIService` is the heart of the app's flexibility. Before every API call, it acts as a builder, constructing a complex JSON payload from scratch:

- It reads over 20 different keys from `UserDefaults`, from the model name to advanced parameters like `frequency_penalty` or `json_schema`.
- It dynamically builds the `tools` array. If `enableWebSearch` is true, it adds the web search tool. If `enableFileSearch` is true and a vector store is selected, it adds the file search tool with the correct `vector_store_ids`.
- It intelligently selects the right parameters for the chosen model, applying `temperature` for GPT models and `reasoning_effort` for o-series models.

This dynamic construction ensures that the app is always in sync with the user's intent and is resilient to API changes.

#### C. Full-Cycle File and Vector Store Management

The OpenResponses app provides complete lifecycle management for files and vector stores, allowing users to upload documents directly or reference existing file IDs.

#### D. Native Computer Use Integration - A Production Success Story

🎉 **Major Achievement**: The OpenResponses app has successfully implemented a fully functional, production-ready computer use system that represents a significant technical milestone. This native iOS implementation evolved through multiple iterations to become a sophisticated, bulletproof solution.

**The Evolution**: Computer use integration began as an external Node.js server dependency but transformed into a comprehensive native iOS solution through systematic refinement. The journey included multiple enhancement phases:

**Phase 1 - Foundation**: Initial implementation with basic `ComputerService.swift` and off-screen `WKWebView` automation.

**Phase 2 - Visual Reliability**: Resolved critical rendering issues where WebView screenshots appeared faded or blank. The solution involved proper window hierarchy attachment at low alpha for solid visual capture.

**Phase 3 - Loop Prevention & Navigate-First**: Implemented intelligent conversation continuity via `previous_response_id` threading, enforced navigate-first behavior to prevent about:blank loops, and added a help page for user guidance.

**Phase 4 - Error Resilience**: Added 404 error mitigation by relying on streaming `call_id`/`action` with `store: true`, implemented one-shot auto-retry for transient streaming errors with preserved context and backoff.

**Phase 5 - Enhanced Interaction**: Developed multi-strategy click implementation for JavaScript-heavy sites (Netflix, React apps), added first-step URL derivation for brand-only inputs, implemented smart confirmation policy reducing unnecessary permission prompts.

**Final Technical Achievements**:

1. **Enhanced Click Reliability**: Multi-strategy approach using element focus, complete mouse event sequences, direct click fallback, and handler triggering specifically designed for modern JavaScript frameworks.

2. **Navigate-First Enforcement**: Comprehensive system preventing screenshot-first loops with mandatory navigation rules, keyword-to-URL mapping, and first-action overrides.

3. **Streaming Resilience**: One-shot auto-retry system handles transient `model_error`/`response.failed` events with preserved `previous_response_id`, user context, and attachments while avoiding UI flicker.

4. **Smart Confirmation Policy**: Eliminates unnecessary "May I proceed?" prompts for benign actions (Learn More, Get Started, navigation) while preserving confirmation for sensitive operations (checkout, subscription, credential entry).

5. **Production Hardening**: Circuit breaker patterns prevent infinite loops, comprehensive error recovery handles unknown actions gracefully, and detailed logging provides actionable feedback.

**The Current State**: The computer use implementation is now **100% feature complete** and production ready. All OpenAI computer actions are supported with defensive programming patterns that prevent breaking changes. The system successfully handles:

- Complete action coverage: navigate, screenshot, click, type, keypress, scroll, wait, drag, double_click, move
- JavaScript-heavy sites like Netflix with enhanced interaction strategies
- Multi-website navigation within single conversations
- Auto-recovery from transient errors without user intervention
- Professional-grade logging and analytics integration

This implementation demonstrates how persistent architectural refinement can transform a challenging integration into a robust, production-ready feature that enhances the overall user experience while maintaining reliability and user safety.

#### E. Real-Time Streaming Feedback System

🎉 **Major UX Achievement**: OpenResponses has implemented a comprehensive real-time streaming feedback system that transforms the user experience from "waiting in the dark" to "seeing AI at work." This system addresses the fundamental UX challenge where users couldn't tell if the application was working or frozen during long-running requests.

**The Problem**: During complex AI tasks (especially reasoning models like o3-deep-research), users would see nothing but a static interface for extended periods, leading to confusion about whether the system was working, frozen, or had encountered an error.

**The Solution - Multi-Layer Feedback Architecture**:

**1. Visual Streaming Indicators**:

- **Blinking Typing Cursor**: A `TypingCursor` view with smooth animation appears in assistant message bubbles during active streaming, providing immediate visual feedback that content is being generated.
- **Live Token Estimation**: Real-time token counting appears next to the cursor and in message captions, showing both estimated output tokens during streaming and final usage counts upon completion.
- **Smooth UI Animations**: Subtle bubble growth animations and auto-scroll behavior create fluid visual feedback as responses develop.

**2. Comprehensive Activity Feed**:

- **Real-Time Activity Logging**: A dedicated `activityLines` system captures and displays human-friendly descriptions of what's happening "under the hood" during streaming.
- **Event Coverage**: Logs activity for all major streaming phases including connection, response creation, reasoning phases, tool usage, computer actions, image generation, and completion.
- **Expandable Details Panel**: An `ActivityFeedView` with toggle button allows users to see detailed progress without cluttering the main interface.

#### E. MCP Discovery System - User-Friendly Tool Integration

🎉 **Major Achievement**: OpenResponses features a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) discovery system that transforms complex server configuration into an intuitive "app store" experience for AI tools.

**The Architecture**: The MCP discovery system consists of three primary components working in harmony:

**1. Data Layer (`MCPModels.swift`)**:

- **MCPServerInfo**: Complete server metadata including display names, descriptions, categories, authentication requirements, and available tools
- **MCPToolInfo**: Detailed tool specifications with schema information, examples, and permission requirements
- **MCPServerConfiguration**: User-specific configurations including enabled status, authentication credentials, selected tools, and approval settings
- **MCPApprovalSettings**: Granular approval control framework supporting per-tool and per-server approval policies

**2. Service Layer (`MCPDiscoveryService.swift`)**:

- **Built-in Registry**: Curated collection of 8+ popular MCP servers (GitHub, Notion, Slack, Google Drive, Shopify, Airtable, Weather, Calculator)
- **Search & Filter**: Semantic search across server names, descriptions, and tool capabilities with category-based filtering
- **Configuration Management**: Persistent storage of user preferences with automatic synchronization to UserDefaults
- **Integration Bridge**: Seamless connection between discovery selections and OpenAI API tool configuration

**3. User Interface (`MCPToolDiscoveryView.swift`)**:

- **Discovery Interface**: Searchable, categorized server browser with official/community badges and authentication indicators
- **Server Detail Views**: Complete server information with tool selection, authentication setup, and usage instructions
- **Settings Integration**: Embedded discovery buttons in existing MCP settings section maintaining backward compatibility

**4. Core Integration**:

- **OpenAIService Enhancement**: `buildTools()` function automatically includes both manually configured servers and discovery-enabled servers
- **Tracking Integration**: `ChatViewModel` and `ModelCompatibilityView` properly detect and track MCP tool usage across all configuration methods
- **Type Safety**: Full integration with existing `APICapabilities` system ensuring compile-time validation

**The User Experience**: Users can now discover MCP tools through an intuitive workflow:

1. Toggle "MCP Tool" in Settings
2. Click "Discover Servers" to browse available integrations
3. Search by category (Development, Productivity, Communication) or functionality
4. Configure authentication with guided forms and built-in help
5. Select specific tools to enable per server
6. Automatically integrated into API calls alongside manual configurations

**Technical Innovation**: The system demonstrates advanced iOS architecture patterns:

- **Service-Oriented Design**: Clear separation between data models, business logic, and UI presentation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing manual MCP configurations continue to work unchanged
- **Configuration Merging**: Intelligent combination of manual and discovery-based server configurations
- **User Experience First**: Complex protocol details abstracted into user-friendly categories and descriptions

**5. MCP Approval System - Phase 1 Completion**:

The final piece of Phase 1 MCP integration was the complete approval workflow implementation:

**Security Architecture**:

- **Ultra-Secure Storage**: Migrated all MCP authentication from UserDefaults to KeychainService with hardware encryption and automatic migration for existing users
- **Secure Headers**: `Prompt.secureMCPHeaders` computed property provides keychain-backed authentication with legacy fallback
- **Integration Health Monitoring**: `MCPIntegrationStatus.swift` provides comprehensive 6-component verification system

**Approval Workflow**:

- **Streaming Event Handling**: Enhanced `handleStreamChunk()` to detect `mcp_approval_request` items in `response.output_item.added` events
- **Intuitive UI**: `MCPApprovalView.swift` presents beautiful approval sheets with parsed tool arguments, security warnings, and clear approve/deny actions
- **Seamless Integration**: Approval sheets integrated into `ChatView` alongside existing safety approvals using SwiftUI sheet presentation
- **API Communication**: `sendMCPApprovalResponse()` method handles the complete approval response flow with comprehensive error handling

**Enhanced User Experience**:

- **One-Click Setup**: GitHub and Notion quick-setup buttons with secure token input fields and visual guidance
- **Ultra-Intuitive UI**: Transformed complex JSON editing into user-friendly configuration with automatic validation
- **Real-Time Debugging**: Enhanced logging throughout MCP flow with server counts, tool inclusion details, and status visibility
- **Complete Integration**: MCP now fully integrated across OpenAIService, MCPDiscoveryService, Prompt, SettingsView, and ChatViewModel

**Result**: Phase 1 MCP integration achieved 100% completion with comprehensive discovery system, ultra-secure authentication, ultra-intuitive user experience, and complete approval workflow.

**3. Technical Implementation Highlights**:

- **Deduplication and Throttling**: Activity feed prevents spam by deduplicating consecutive identical events and capping the total number of lines.
- **Live Observable State**: Uses `@ObservedObject` pattern to ensure the Details panel updates immediately when toggled and reflects real-time changes.
- **Performance Optimization**: `ChatView` was refactored into smaller `@ViewBuilder` components to resolve compiler type-checking performance issues while maintaining functionality.

**4. Status Integration**:

- **Enhanced Status Mapping**: Expanded `updateStreamingStatus()` to cover additional streaming events like `response.in_progress`, `response.output_item.added/delta/completed`, ensuring continuous feedback throughout the entire response lifecycle.
- **Contextual Status Display**: Status chips show appropriate activities ("Working…", "Running tool: web_search_preview", "🖥️ Using computer…") based on the current phase.

**The Impact**: This system completely eliminates the "frozen interface" perception by providing continuous, informative feedback about AI processing. Users can now see:

- When the AI is connecting and starting work
- Which reasoning phase is active
- What tools are being invoked
- Real-time progress during computer automation
- Estimated and final token usage throughout conversations

**Technical Architecture**: The feedback system integrates seamlessly with the existing MVVM pattern, using published properties on `ChatViewModel` that drive UI updates through SwiftUI's reactive binding system. The `ActivityVisibility` singleton provides app-wide toggle state, while the modular component design ensures the feature can be easily extended or customized.

This implementation demonstrates how thoughtful UX design combined with robust technical architecture can transform complex AI interactions into transparent, confidence-inspiring user experiences.

File Search is not just a toggle; it's a complete management system.

- **The Challenge**: The API requires multiple steps to use File Search: upload a file, create a vector store, and then associate the file with the store.
- **The Solution**: The `FileManagerView` provides a dedicated UI for this entire lifecycle. It performs full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations for both files and vector stores. A user can:
    1. Upload files.
    1. Create a new vector store, optionally associating files at creation time.
    1. View all files within a store.
    1. Add existing files to a store.
    1. Remove files from a store.
    1. Edit a store's name and metadata.
    1. Delete files and stores entirely.
- **Multi-Store Support**: The UI also supports selecting multiple vector stores for a single search, a powerful feature for querying across different knowledge bases.

This makes a highly complex workflow intuitive and manageable for the end-user.

#### D. File Attachments: Immediate Context

Distinct from the persistent, searchable knowledge base of Vector Stores, OpenResponses also supports direct file attachments. This feature allows a user to upload a file and have it included as context for the _very next_ message.

- **The Use Case**: Providing one-off context, such as asking the model to summarize a document, analyze a log file, or answer questions about a specific PDF without first adding it to a permanent vector store.
- **Implementation**: The flow is streamlined for simplicity. The `ChatViewModel` manages a temporary list of pending file IDs. When the user sends a message, these IDs are formatted into the `attachments` array of the API request and the list is cleared. This provides immediate, ephemeral context for a single turn of conversation.

### 4. Advanced Features: Professional-Grade Tooling

OpenResponses goes beyond basic chat functionality to provide enterprise-level features for serious AI work.

#### A. Prompt Management and Presets

The `PromptLibrary` system allows users to save and manage complex configurations:

- **State Persistence**: All settings (model, tools, parameters) are captured in a `Prompt` struct that can be saved to `UserDefaults`.
- **Quick Switching**: Users can instantly switch between different "profiles" for different use cases (e.g., code analysis, creative writing, research).
- **Configuration Reuse**: Complex setups with specific tool combinations and API parameters can be preserved and shared.

#### B. Debugging and Transparency Tools

Professional users need visibility into API interactions:

- **API Inspector**: The `APIInspectorView` provides real-time visibility into every request and response, with JSON pretty-printing and detailed headers.
- **Debug Console**: A `DebugConsoleView` shows live application logs with filtering by category and severity level.
- **Analytics Service**: Tracks performance metrics, request patterns, and provides insights into API usage.

#### C. Advanced Integrations

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Connects to external services and data sources through standardized protocol interfaces.
- **Custom Tools**: Users can define their own tools with specific schemas and behaviors.
- **Multi-Store Search**: Advanced file search across multiple vector stores simultaneously for complex knowledge bases.
- **Computer Use Preview**: 🎉 **Production-Ready Native Implementation**.

Successfully captures and displays screenshots from actual webpage content. Includes intelligent single-shot mode, real-time status chips, comprehensive error handling, and proper API compliance. Model compatibility checking automatically disables the feature for unsupported models (e.g., gpt-5 series).

#### D. Accessibility as a First-Class Feature

The `AccessibilityUtils` system provides:

- **Centralized Configuration**: Consistent accessibility labels, hints, and identifiers across the entire app.
- **VoiceOver Optimization**: Every feature, including debugging tools, is fully accessible.
- **Testing Integration**: Accessibility identifiers enable comprehensive UI testing.

### 5. Phase 1 Completion: Production-Ready Implementation
