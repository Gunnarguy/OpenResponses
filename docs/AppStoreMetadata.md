## Full Description (≤4000 characters)

OpenResponses puts the OpenAI Responses API in your pocket. Built in SwiftUI for iOS 17+, it gives builders, developers, and power users the precision tools they need—real-time streaming, deep configuration, file intelligence, and secure integrations—all in a polished native experience.

### Why You'll Love It

- Dynamic model gallery covering GPT-5 family (with configurable reasoning effort), GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini/nano, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, o1, o3, o4-mini, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-3.5 fallback models—plus gpt-image-1 for visuals and computer-use-preview for automation
- Pro controls for temperature, reasoning effort, max tokens, tool routing, and moderation—all in one place
- Built-in compatibility guidance so every model and tool combination stays within OpenAI and App Store policies
- Save, organize, and reuse prompt setups across projects with the Prompt Library

### Conversations Reimagined

- Stream responses token by token with inline reasoning indicators
- Inspect every API payload, response include, and tool call in the Request Inspector
- Maintain local conversation history with export-ready transcripts

### Pro Tools Included

- **Code Interpreter:** Execute Python, create charts, and inspect files securely on-device
- **Web Search:** Pull in live web answers with citations you can trust
- **Image Generation:** Create visuals on demand with gpt-image-1
- **Computer Use Preview:** Automate workflows with computer-use-preview models
- **File & Vector Search:** Upload documents, build vector stores, and query your knowledge base instantly

### Connect Everything with MCP

- Native Model Context Protocol (MCP) client to link Notion, Google Drive, GitHub, Slack, and custom servers
- One-tap approval for tool calls with granular permissions
- Secure token management through the iOS Keychain

### Built for Apple

- SwiftUI interface optimized for iPhone with buttery smooth animations
- Dark Mode, Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, and reduced motion fully supported
- Calendar, Contacts, and Reminders access via AI tools—always under your control
- User-in-the-loop approvals for computer-use and sensitive actions to satisfy Apple’s 2025 generative AI disclosure guidance

### Privacy First

- Your API keys stay on-device in the Keychain
- No analytics, no tracking, no accounts—ever
- All conversations and configuration data remain local unless you export them
- Safety notices in onboarding and the chat composer remind you that AI output can be inaccurate and to keep sensitive information out of prompts

Whether you are prototyping AI features, automating research, or managing complex workflows, OpenResponses gives you complete insight and control over every OpenAI request. Bring professional-grade assistance everywhere you go.

AI-generated output can be inaccurate or outdated—always review critical information before acting.

### Requirements

- OpenAI API key (setup instructions appear in-app; reviewers may use their own key or a key provided in App Review notes)
- Active OpenAI billing for that key—usage charges accrue directly to the reviewer or user
