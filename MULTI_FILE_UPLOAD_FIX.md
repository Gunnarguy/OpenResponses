# Multi-File Upload Fix Summary

## Problem
Users reported being unable to upload more than 1 file, with presentation conflict errors appearing in the logs:
```
Attempt to present <UIDocumentPickerViewController> which is already presenting another sheet
```

## Root Cause
Multiple UI elements were attempting to present file picker sheets simultaneously without proper coordination, causing SwiftUI presentation conflicts.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Presentation Coordination System
- **New state variable**: `isPresentationLocked` to prevent rapid successive presentations
- **Enhanced detection**: Updated `isAnySheetPresented` to include the presentation lock
- **Centralized method**: Created `presentFilePicker(for:)` for safe file picker presentation

```swift
@State private var isPresentationLocked = false

@MainActor
private func presentFilePicker(for vectorStore: VectorStore? = nil) {
    guard !isAnySheetPresented else {
        AppLogger.log("‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot present file picker - another sheet is already presented", category: .fileManager, level: .warning)
        return
    }
    
    // Lock presentations temporarily
    isPresentationLocked = true
    
    // Set target and present
    targetVectorStoreForUpload = vectorStore
    showingFilePicker = true
    
    // Unlock after a delay
    Task { @MainActor in
        try? await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(1000))
        isPresentationLocked = false
    }
}
```

### 2. Updated All File Picker Presentations
Replaced direct `showingFilePicker = true` calls with the safer `presentFilePicker()` method in:
- Quick Actions tab "Upload File Only" button
- Vector Stores tab "Upload New File" button  
- Vector store row "Add Files" button
- VectorStoreDetailView callback coordination
- QuickUpload onChange handler

### 3. Added Automatic Lock Reset
Added onChange handler to reset the presentation lock when file picker is dismissed:

```swift
.onChange(of: showingFilePicker) { _, newValue in
    if !newValue {
        isPresentationLocked = false
        AppLogger.log("üîì File picker dismissed, presentation lock reset", category: .fileManager, level: .debug)
    }
}
```

### 4. Removed Duplicate File Picker
Previously, `VectorStoreDetailView` had its own file picker which caused conflicts. Now it uses a callback approach to coordinate with the parent FileManagerView.

## Expected Results
- ‚úÖ Users can now upload multiple files without presentation conflicts
- ‚úÖ Better logging shows when presentation conflicts are detected and prevented
- ‚úÖ 1-second debounce prevents rapid button tapping issues
- ‚úÖ Automatic lock reset ensures the UI doesn't get stuck in locked state

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test multi-file selection (hold Cmd while clicking files)
2. Test rapid clicking of "Add Files" buttons
3. Test uploading to different vector stores in sequence
4. Verify the 1-second debounce works as expected
5. Check logs for proper coordination messages

## Files Modified
- `FileManagerView.swift`: Added presentation coordination system and updated all file picker calls

## Impact
This fix resolves the multi-file upload issue while maintaining all existing functionality and improving the overall reliability of the file management UI.
