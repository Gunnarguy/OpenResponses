# Enhanced Multi-File Upload Fix - Race Condition Resolution

## Updated Problem Analysis
The initial fix successfully added presentation coordination, but logs revealed a race condition where multiple `presentFilePicker()` calls could pass the guard check before the first one set `showingFilePicker = true`.

## Enhanced Solution

### 1. Pre-Check State Logic
Updated `presentFilePicker()` to check state BEFORE making any changes:

```swift
// Check current state BEFORE making any changes
let currentlyPresented = showingFilePicker || showingCreateVectorStore || showingEditVectorStore || 
                        showingQuickUpload || selectedVectorStore != nil || vectorStoreToEdit != nil

guard !currentlyPresented && !isPresentationLocked else {
    AppLogger.log("‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot present file picker - another sheet is already presented (currentlyPresented: \(currentlyPresented), locked: \(isPresentationLocked))", category: .fileManager, level: .warning)
    return
}

// Lock presentations immediately to prevent race conditions
isPresentationLocked = true
```

### 2. Comprehensive Presentation Tracking
Enhanced `isAnySheetPresented` to include ALL presentation states:

```swift
private var isAnySheetPresented: Bool {
    showingFilePicker || showingCreateVectorStore || showingEditVectorStore || 
    showingQuickUpload || selectedVectorStore != nil || vectorStoreToEdit != nil ||
    showingDeleteFileConfirmation || showingDeleteVectorStoreConfirmation || 
    isPresentationLocked || (errorMessage != nil)
}
```

### 3. Improved Lock Management
- **Immediate locking**: `isPresentationLocked = true` set BEFORE any sheet presentation
- **Extended lock time**: Increased to 1.5 seconds to prevent rapid successive calls
- **Delayed unlock**: Both automatic (after delay) and onChange-triggered unlock
- **Better logging**: Enhanced debug logging for state changes

### 4. Enhanced State Change Monitoring
Added onChange handlers to track all presentation state changes:

```swift
.onChange(of: showingFilePicker) { _, newValue in
    AppLogger.log("üéØ showingFilePicker changed to: \(newValue)", category: .fileManager, level: .debug)
}
.onChange(of: selectedVectorStore) { _, newValue in
    AppLogger.log("üéØ selectedVectorStore changed to: \(newValue?.name ?? "nil")", category: .fileManager, level: .debug)
}
.onChange(of: isAnySheetPresented) { _, newValue in
    AppLogger.log("üéØ isAnySheetPresented changed to: \(newValue)", category: .fileManager, level: .debug)
}
```

## Race Condition Prevention Strategy

### Before (Race Condition Possible):
1. User clicks "Add Files" button A ‚Üí calls `presentFilePicker()`
2. User quickly clicks "Add Files" button B ‚Üí calls `presentFilePicker()`
3. Both calls pass `guard !isAnySheetPresented` check simultaneously
4. Both set `showingFilePicker = true` ‚Üí UIKit presentation conflict

### After (Race Condition Prevented):
1. User clicks "Add Files" button A ‚Üí calls `presentFilePicker()`
2. `isPresentationLocked = true` set immediately
3. User clicks "Add Files" button B ‚Üí calls `presentFilePicker()`
4. Second call fails guard check due to `isPresentationLocked = true`
5. Only first call proceeds ‚Üí No UIKit conflict

## Expected Results
- ‚úÖ **Eliminates race conditions** between rapid button presses
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive state tracking** includes all sheets and dialogs
- ‚úÖ **Better debugging** with detailed state change logging
- ‚úÖ **Multi-file support preserved** - users can still select multiple files
- ‚úÖ **Graceful degradation** - conflicts detected and logged rather than crashing

## Testing
The enhanced logging will show exactly when and why presentation attempts are blocked, making it easier to verify the fix is working correctly.
