# Debounced Refresh Fix for Batch File Deletions

## Problem

When users swipe-delete multiple files rapidly from a vector store, the original implementation would:
1. Delete file 1 ‚Üí trigger immediate refresh
2. Delete file 2 ‚Üí trigger immediate refresh
3. Delete file 3 (already gone) ‚Üí show error message ‚Üí trigger immediate refresh
4. Delete file 4 (already gone) ‚Üí show error message ‚Üí trigger immediate refresh
5. etc.

This caused:
- **Multiple unnecessary API calls** (one refresh per deletion)
- **UI flicker** from repeated refreshes
- **Confusing error messages** for files that were legitimately removed
- **Poor UX** ("clunky" feeling)

## Solution: Debounced Refresh

Implemented a **debounced refresh mechanism** that:
- Waits 500ms after the last deletion before refreshing
- Cancels pending refreshes when new deletions occur
- Only makes one final refresh after batch operations complete
- Treats "file not found" errors as expected during batch operations (no error message shown)

## Implementation

### 1. Added State Variable
```swift
@State private var pendingRefreshTask: Task<Void, Never>?
```

### 2. Created Debounced Refresh Helper
```swift
@MainActor
private func scheduleRefresh(for vectorStoreId: String, delay: TimeInterval = 0.5) {
    // Cancel any pending refresh
    pendingRefreshTask?.cancel()
    
    // Schedule a new refresh after the delay
    pendingRefreshTask = Task {
        try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: UInt64(delay * 1_000_000_000))
        
        // Only proceed if not cancelled
        guard !Task.isCancelled else { return }
        
        AppLogger.log("üîÑ Executing debounced refresh for vector store \(vectorStoreId)", category: .fileManager, level: .info)
        await loadVectorStoreFiles(vectorStoreId)
    }
}
```

### 3. Updated File Removal Logic
Changed from immediate refresh to debounced refresh:
```swift
// OLD: await loadVectorStoreFiles(vectorStoreId)
// NEW: scheduleRefresh(for: vectorStoreId)
```

Also removed the "File was already removed" error message for 404 errors during batch operations, since this is expected behavior.

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
```
[User swipes 5 files rapidly]
‚úÖ Delete 1 ‚Üí Refresh ‚Üí UI flicker
‚úÖ Delete 2 ‚Üí Refresh ‚Üí UI flicker
‚ùå Delete 3 ‚Üí "File was already removed" ‚Üí Refresh ‚Üí UI flicker
‚ùå Delete 4 ‚Üí "File was already removed" ‚Üí Refresh ‚Üí UI flicker
‚ùå Delete 5 ‚Üí "File was already removed" ‚Üí Refresh ‚Üí UI flicker
Result: 5 API calls, 5 UI updates, 3 error messages
```

### After:
```
[User swipes 5 files rapidly]
‚úÖ Delete 1 ‚Üí schedule refresh
‚úÖ Delete 2 ‚Üí cancel previous, schedule refresh
‚úÖ Delete 3 (already gone) ‚Üí cancel previous, schedule refresh
‚úÖ Delete 4 (already gone) ‚Üí cancel previous, schedule refresh
‚úÖ Delete 5 (already gone) ‚Üí cancel previous, schedule refresh
[500ms pause]
üîÑ Execute single refresh
Result: 1 API call, 1 UI update, 0 error messages
```

## Technical Details

### Delay Duration
- **500ms** provides a good balance:
  - Long enough to batch rapid user actions
  - Short enough that users don't notice the delay
  - Can be adjusted via the `delay` parameter

### Task Cancellation
- Each new deletion cancels the previous pending refresh
- Uses Swift's structured concurrency (`Task.isCancelled`)
- Prevents wasted API calls and stale refreshes

### Error Handling
- **404 errors** during batch operations are treated as informational (no user-facing error)
- **Other errors** still show user-friendly messages
- All errors still log to AppLogger for debugging

## Files Modified

- `OpenResponses/Features/Chat/Components/FileManagerView.swift`
  - Added `pendingRefreshTask` state variable
  - Added `scheduleRefresh(for:delay:)` helper method
  - Updated `removeFileFromVectorStore(_:fileId:)` to use debounced refresh

## Testing

To verify the improvement:
1. Open a vector store with multiple files
2. Rapidly swipe-delete 5-10 files in quick succession
3. Observe:
   - ‚úÖ No UI flicker during deletions
   - ‚úÖ Single refresh after ~500ms
   - ‚úÖ No error messages for expected 404s
   - ‚úÖ Clean, smooth UX

## Benefits

1. **Performance:** Reduces API calls by up to 90% during batch operations
2. **UX:** Eliminates UI flicker and confusing error messages
3. **Scalability:** Pattern can be applied to other batch operations (uploads, moves, etc.)
4. **Robustness:** Still handles real errors appropriately

## Future Enhancements

This debounced refresh pattern could be extended to:
- Batch file uploads
- Batch file moves between vector stores
- Any other multi-item operations with UI updates
