# üîå MCP Connector Disconnect Functionality

## Overview

Added the ability to **disconnect/remove** MCP connector and remote server configurations from the app, solving the problem where connections showed as "Connected" but couldn't be removed or reconfigured.

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Before:** 
- Once a connector was configured, there was no way to disconnect it
- Users couldn't clear invalid configurations (like the `connector_notion` issue)
- No visual indication of which connectors were actually connected
- Had to manually delete from Settings or reinstall app to reset

**After:**
- ‚úÖ Visual connection status indicators
- ‚úÖ One-tap disconnect button
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog before removing credentials
- ‚úÖ Proper cleanup of Keychain entries
- ‚úÖ Green border and badge for connected connectors

## üé® UI Enhancements

### Connection Status Indicators

**Green Dot Badge:**
- Appears on connector icon when credentials are stored
- Visual confirmation that setup is complete

**"Connected" Badge:**
- Shows in top-right of connector card
- Green pill with "Connected" text

**Green Border:**
- Connected connectors have green border instead of gray/orange
- Makes it obvious which are configured

### Button States

**Not Connected:**
- Shows "Setup" (remote servers) or "Connect" (connectors)
- Blue button only

**Connected:**
- Shows "Reconfigure" (remote servers) or "Update" (connectors)  
- Blue button for updating + Red X button for disconnecting

### Disconnect Button

- Red X icon with red background
- Shows confirmation alert before removing
- Explains that credentials will be deleted

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Connection Detection

```swift
private var isConnected: Bool {
    if connector.requiresRemoteServer {
        // For remote servers: check "mcp_auth_{connector.name}"
        let authKey = "mcp_auth_\(connector.name)"
        return KeychainService.shared.load(forKey: authKey) != nil
    } else {
        // For connectors: check "mcp_connector_{connector.id}"
        let keychainKey = "mcp_connector_\(connector.id)"
        return KeychainService.shared.load(forKey: keychainKey) != nil
    }
}
```

### Disconnect Function

```swift
private func disconnectConnector() {
    if connector.requiresRemoteServer {
        // Remove remote server auth token
        let authKey = "mcp_auth_\(connector.name)"
        KeychainService.shared.delete(forKey: authKey)
        AppLogger.log("üîå Disconnected remote server: \(connector.name)")
    } else {
        // Remove connector OAuth token
        let keychainKey = "mcp_connector_\(connector.id)"
        KeychainService.shared.delete(forKey: keychainKey)
        AppLogger.log("üîå Disconnected connector: \(connector.name)")
    }
}
```

## üé¨ User Flow

### Disconnecting a Connector

1. **Open Settings** ‚Üí MCP Connectors
2. **Find connected connector** (has green dot + "Connected" badge)
3. **Tap red X button**
4. **Confirm in alert dialog**
5. **Credentials removed** - connector returns to "not connected" state

### Reconfiguring a Connector

1. **Tap blue "Reconfigure"/"Update" button** on connected connector
2. **Goes through setup flow** with existing values pre-filled (if possible)
3. **Save new credentials** - overwrites old ones

## ‚úÖ Benefits

### For Users
- **Clear visual feedback** about what's connected
- **Easy cleanup** of test/invalid configurations
- **Safe removal** with confirmation dialog
- **Quick reconfiguration** without manual Keychain cleanup

### For Development
- **Faster testing** - can quickly disconnect and reconnect
- **Better debugging** - can see connection state at a glance
- **Cleaner UX** - no orphaned configurations

## üîÑ Use Cases

### Fixing the Notion Issue
1. Disconnect the old invalid "connector_notion" configuration
2. Reconfigure Notion as a remote server
3. Enter proper server URL and token
4. Test with clean state

### Switching Accounts
1. Disconnect Gmail connector
2. Get new OAuth token for different account
3. Reconnect with new credentials

### Testing Multiple Configurations
1. Configure test server
2. Test functionality
3. Disconnect test server
4. Configure production server

### Cleanup After Error
1. If connector shows "Connected" but doesn't work
2. Disconnect to clear cached credentials
3. Reconnect with fresh authentication

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Keychain Key Patterns

**Remote Servers:**
- Pattern: `mcp_auth_{serverLabel}`
- Example: `mcp_auth_Notion Local Test`

**Connectors:**
- Pattern: `mcp_connector_{connectorId}`
- Example: `mcp_connector_connector_gmail`

### State Management

- Connection status is **computed** on each render
- Checks Keychain directly (no cached state)
- Automatically updates when credentials are added/removed
- No need to manually refresh the view

### Visual Design

- **Green** = connected and ready
- **Orange** = requires remote server setup
- **Blue** = action buttons
- **Red** = destructive disconnect action

## üöÄ Next Steps for User

1. **Rebuild the app** with the new disconnect functionality
2. **Disconnect any existing Notion configuration** (if it shows connected)
3. **Reconfigure Notion properly** as remote server:
   - Server Label: `Notion Local Test`
   - Server URL: `http://localhost:8080/mcp`
   - Auth Token: `d8c1951770d3b4bb906fad95d0d74500cf418c974e49251c8aefd32eeee84938`
4. **Test** - should see proper remote server configuration in logs

## üéâ Result

Users can now fully manage their MCP connections with visual feedback and easy cleanup, making the testing and configuration process much smoother!
