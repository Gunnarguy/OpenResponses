# Authentication

Notion REST API requests use the HTTP `Authorization` header to authenticate and authorize operations. The Notion API accepts bearer tokens in this header.

Important notes:
- The `Notion-Version` header is **required** for REST API requests. The most recent version is `2025-09-03`.
- Tokens may start with `ntn_` or `secret_` (and may change again). Treat tokens as **opaque strings** and do not regex-validate formats.
- Keep tokens secret: never commit them to source control, paste them into issues/support tickets, or log them.

```bash
curl 'https://api.notion.com/v1/users' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_TOKEN" \
  -H "Notion-Version: 2025-09-03"
```

## Notion MCP (hosted) vs self-hosted MCP

Notion has a hosted MCP server (“Notion MCP”) at:
- https://mcp.notion.com/mcp (Streamable HTTP)
- https://mcp.notion.com/sse (SSE)

Notion MCP is designed to be connected via **OAuth** through the Notion app or your AI tool (no need to manually paste an integration token into your client config).

If you’re self-hosting an MCP server that talks to the Notion REST API (for example, Notion’s open-source MCP server), follow the server’s docs and provide the Notion integration token via **server-side environment variables** (never from an untrusted client). If the server exposes an HTTP endpoint, protect it with its own authentication mechanism as well.

See:
- Connecting to Notion MCP: https://developers.notion.com/docs/get-started-with-mcp
- Notion MCP security best practices: https://developers.notion.com/docs/mcp-security-best-practices

Inside Notion, users will see updates made by integrations attributed to a bot. The bot's name and avatar are controlled in the integration settings.

Using a Notion SDK, a bearer token can be passed once to initialize a `Client` and the client can be used to send multiple authenticated requests.

```javascript Notion SDK for JS
const { Client } = require('@notionhq/client');

const client = new Client({ auth: process.env.NOTION_TOKEN });
```


If you’re upgrading from older API versions (like `2022-06-28`), read Notion’s upgrade guide for `2025-09-03`—especially if you interact with databases, since many operations move from `database_id` to `data_source_id`.
