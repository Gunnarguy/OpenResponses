# Authentication

Requests use the HTTP `Authorization` header to both authenticate and authorize operations. The Notion API accepts bearer tokens in this header. Bearer tokens are provided to you when you create an integration. If you're creating a public OAuth integration, the integration also receives bearer tokens each time a user completes the OAuth flow.

```curl
curl 'https://api.notion.com/v1/users' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer '"$NOTION_ACCESS_TOKEN"'' \
  -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28"
```

> MCP Auth Quick Note
> - Official Notion MCP (https://mcp.notion.com/mcp): provide your Notion Integration token as the TOP-LEVEL authorization value (raw ntn_/secret_), not "Bearer ...". The client omits the Authorization header entirely and sends the raw token at top level. The client may include an mcp-session-id header to correlate sessions.
> - Self-hosted Notion MCP: authenticate using the SERVER-ISSUED Bearer token in the Authorization header. Your Notion Integration token should only be set in the container environment as NOTION_API_KEY and never sent by the client.
>
> This differs from the standard Notion REST API examples below, which use an Authorization: Bearer ... header.

Inside Notion, users will see updates made by integrations attributed to a bot. The bot's name and avatar are controlled in the integration settings.

Using a [Notion SDK](https://notionapi.readme.io/reference/intro#code-samples--sdks), a bearer token can be passed once to initialize a `Client` and the client can be used to send multiple authenticated requests.

```javascript Notion SDK for JS
const { Client } = require('@notionhq/client');

const client = new Client({ auth: process.env.NOTION_ACCESS_TOKEN });
```
