# Real-Time Upload Progress Implementation

## Overview
Added **live progress tracking** that shows real-time status updates during file uploads, so users can see exactly what's happening instead of waiting for a "bam and bam" completion.

## Problem Statement
The upload summary was only shown **after** all files were processed. During the actual upload and processing:
- No visual feedback
- Users couldn't see conversion progress
- No indication of which step was happening
- Just appeared as instant jumps ("bam and bam")

User wanted to see files being uploaded and processed **in real-time** with detailed status updates.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Real-Time Progress Tracking Models**

#### UploadProgressItem
```swift
struct UploadProgressItem: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let filename: String
    var status: UploadProgressStatus
    var statusMessage: String
    var progress: Double // 0.0 to 1.0
}
```

#### UploadProgressStatus
```swift
enum UploadProgressStatus {
    case pending           // ⏰ Waiting...
    case converting        // 🔄 Validating & converting...
    case uploading         // ☁️ Uploading to OpenAI...
    case addingToVectorStore // 🔗 Adding to vector store...
    case processing        // ⚙️ Processing chunks...
    case completed         // ✅ Complete!
    case failed            // ❌ Failed
}
```

Each status has its own icon and color for visual clarity.

### 2. **Progress State Management**

Added to FileManagerView:
```swift
@State private var isUploading = false
@State private var currentUploadProgress: [UploadProgressItem] = []
```

### 3. **Live Progress Updates**

The upload flow now updates progress at every stage:

```swift
// Initialize progress items when upload starts
isUploading = true
currentUploadProgress = urls.map { url in
    UploadProgressItem(
        filename: url.lastPathComponent,
        status: .pending,
        statusMessage: "Waiting...",
        progress: 0.0
    )
}

// Update during conversion
currentUploadProgress[index].status = .converting
currentUploadProgress[index].statusMessage = "Validating & converting..."
currentUploadProgress[index].progress = 0.2

// Update during upload
currentUploadProgress[index].status = .uploading
currentUploadProgress[index].statusMessage = "Uploading to OpenAI..."
currentUploadProgress[index].progress = 0.5

// Update when adding to vector store
currentUploadProgress[index].status = .addingToVectorStore
currentUploadProgress[index].statusMessage = "Adding to vector store..."
currentUploadProgress[index].progress = 0.8

// Update during processing
currentUploadProgress[index].status = .processing
currentUploadProgress[index].statusMessage = "Processing chunks..."
currentUploadProgress[index].progress = 0.9

// Complete
currentUploadProgress[index].status = .completed
currentUploadProgress[index].statusMessage = "Complete!"
currentUploadProgress[index].progress = 1.0
```

### 4. **Beautiful Progress Overlay**

#### UploadProgressOverlay
- Semi-transparent dark background (blocks interaction)
- Centered floating card with rounded corners and shadow
- Header showing "Uploading Files" with count (e.g., "2 of 5 complete")
- Scrollable list of all files with individual progress

#### UploadProgressRow
Each file shows:
- **Animated status icon** (pulses during active operations)
- **Filename** (truncated if needed)
- **Status message** (descriptive text like "Converted via OCR")
- **Progress bar** (animated 0-100% fill)
- **Completion indicator** (checkmark when done, spinner when active)

### 5. **Progress Bar Animation**

The progress bar smoothly animates through stages:
- 0% → Pending
- 20% → Converting
- 40% → Converted
- 50% → Uploading
- 70% → Uploaded
- 80% → Adding to vector store
- 90% → Processing
- 100% → Complete

## Visual Experience

### Before (No Feedback)
```
[User taps upload]
...silence...
...silence...
[Upload summary appears]
```

### After (Real-Time Progress)
```
[User taps upload]

## Status Icons & Colors

| Status | Icon | Color | Animation |
|--------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pending | ⏰ clock.fill | Gray | Static |
| Converting | 🔄 arrow.triangle.2.circlepath | Blue | Pulse |
| Uploading | ☁️ arrow.up.circle.fill | Orange | Pulse |
| Adding to VS | 🔗 link.circle.fill | Purple | Pulse |
| Processing | ⚙️ gearshape.fill | Cyan | Pulse |
| Completed | ✅ checkmark.circle.fill | Green | Scale in |
| Failed | ❌ xmark.circle.fill | Red | Static |

## Progress Stages Breakdown

### Stage 1: Converting (0% → 40%)
- Validates file format
- Performs conversion if needed (OCR, DOCX, CSV, etc.)
- Shows conversion method in status message

### Stage 2: Uploading (40% → 70%)
- Uploads file data to OpenAI
- Shows "Uploading to OpenAI..." message
- Animated progress bar

### Stage 3: Adding to Vector Store (70% → 90%)
- Links file to vector store
- Shows "Adding to vector store..." message
- Only appears if uploading to a vector store

### Stage 4: Processing (90% → 95%)
- Vector store is chunking and indexing
- Shows "Processing chunks..." message
- Only if status is "in_progress"

### Stage 5: Complete (100%)
- File fully processed
- Green checkmark appears
- Progress bar disappears

## Error Handling

If a file fails at any stage:
- Status changes to `.failed`
- Icon shows red X
- Progress bar disappears
- Status message shows "Failed"
- Error details captured in UploadResult
- Upload continues with remaining files

## Files Modified

### `/OpenResponses/Features/Chat/Components/FileManagerView.swift`

**State Variables (Lines 73-77):**
- Added `isUploading: Bool` - Controls overlay visibility
- Added `currentUploadProgress: [UploadProgressItem]` - Tracks each file's progress

**Progress Models (Lines 2653-2695):**
- `UploadProgressItem` struct - Individual file progress
- `UploadProgressStatus` enum - Status with icons and colors

**Upload Handler (Lines 970-1140):**
- Initialize progress tracking on upload start
- Update progress at each stage (converting, uploading, adding to VS, processing)
- Mark as complete or failed
- Hide overlay when done

**Progress Overlay (Lines 3174-3295):**
- `UploadProgressOverlay` - Main floating card view
- `UploadProgressRow` - Individual file progress display

**View Integration (Lines 758-762):**
- Added `.overlay` modifier to show progress when `isUploading` is true

## Benefits

### 1. **Complete Visibility**
Users see exactly what's happening at every moment

### 2. **Reduced Anxiety**
No more wondering if the app froze or if files are uploading

### 3. **Progress Feedback**
Visual progress bars show how far along each file is

### 4. **Stage Clarity**
Clear status messages explain each processing step

### 5. **Error Awareness**
Failed files are immediately visible with error indication

### 6. **Multi-File Tracking**
Can see progress of all files simultaneously

### 7. **Beautiful UI**
Polished overlay with smooth animations and clear hierarchy

## Technical Details

### Animation System
- `.symbolEffect(.pulse)` for active status icons
- `.easeInOut` for progress bar fills
- `.spring()` for overlay appearance/disappearance
- Smooth transitions between states

### Performance
- Lightweight updates (only status string and progress value)
- Efficient list rendering with `ForEach` and `Identifiable`
- Progress overlay doesn't block UI rendering
- Background dimming prevents accidental interaction

### User Experience Flow
1. User selects files
2. Overlay appears immediately with all files listed as "Pending"
3. Files process sequentially, each updating its own progress
4. Completed files show checkmarks
5. When all done, overlay fades out
6. Upload summary sheet appears

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload single file - verify progress shows all stages
- [ ] Upload multiple files - verify each file has independent progress
- [ ] Upload with conversion (PDF, DOCX) - verify conversion stage shows
- [ ] Upload to vector store - verify "Adding to vector store" stage
- [ ] File with in_progress status - verify "Processing chunks" stage
- [ ] Failed upload - verify error state with red X
- [ ] Multiple files with one failure - verify upload continues
- [ ] Progress bar animations - verify smooth transitions
- [ ] Status icons - verify pulse animation on active states
- [ ] Checkmark appearance - verify scale animation
- [ ] Overlay dismiss - verify smooth fade out
- [ ] Upload summary - verify appears after overlay dismisses

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
- **Speed indicator** - Show MB/s upload speed
- **Time remaining** - Estimate based on progress
- **Cancel button** - Allow user to abort upload
- **Retry failed** - Quick retry for failed files
- **Parallel uploads** - Upload multiple files simultaneously
- **Detailed error messages** - Show why file failed in overlay

## Success Criteria

✅ **Real-time feedback**: Progress updates as upload happens  
✅ **Stage visibility**: Each processing step is shown  
✅ **Multi-file support**: Track multiple files independently  
✅ **Visual clarity**: Icons, colors, and animations are clear  
✅ **Smooth UX**: Animations and transitions are polished  
✅ **Error handling**: Failed uploads are clearly indicated  
✅ **Non-blocking**: Overlay appears but doesn't crash app
