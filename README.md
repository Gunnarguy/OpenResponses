2. Models are intelligently categorized: "Latest & Greatest", "Reasoning Specialists", "Proven Performers".
3. Includes fallback models for offline use.
4. Smart filtering shows only chat-compatible models.
5. Real-time model descriptions help you choose the right model for your task.

### Prompt Presets

Create and manage reusable prompt configurations:

1. Configure your settings (model, tools, parameters) in the main Settings screen.
2. Tap "Manage Presets" to open the Prompt Library.
3. Tap "+" to save your current configuration as a new preset.
4. Switch between presets using the dropdown in Settings.

### File Management

Upload and search through documents:

1. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí "Manage Files & Vector Stores".
2. Upload files using the "Upload File" button.
3. Create vector stores to organize related documents.
4. Enable "File Search" in Settings and select your vector store.
5. Ask questions about your documents in the chat interface.

### Web Search Configuration

Customize web search behavior:

1. Enable "Web Search" in Settings ‚Üí Tools.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

OpenResponses is built with SwiftUI and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern with additional service layers for robust functionality.

### Core Architecture

- **`OpenResponsesApp.swift`**: The app's entry point, which injects the shared `ChatViewModel` and manages app-wide state.
- **`ChatView.swift`**: The main UI, containing the message list, input view, and settings navigation.
- **`ChatViewModel.swift`**: The central ViewModel, managing chat state, API calls, and error handling.

### Service Layer

- **`OpenAIService.swift`**: The networking layer responsible for all communication with the OpenAI API.
- **`KeychainService.swift`**: Securely manages the OpenAI API key and sensitive data.
- **`AnalyticsService.swift`**: Tracks API requests, performance metrics, and provides debugging insights.
- **`AppLogger.swift`**: Centralized logging system with categorization and structured output.
- **`NetworkMonitor.swift`**: Monitors network connectivity and handles offline scenarios.

### Management Systems

- **`PromptLibrary.swift`**: Manages saved prompt presets and configurations.
- **`FileManagerView.swift`**: Comprehensive file and vector store management interface.
- **`AccessibilityUtils.swift`**: Centralized accessibility configuration and utilities.

### Development Tools

- **`APIInspectorView.swift`**: Real-time API request/response inspection for debugging.
- **`DebugConsoleView.swift`**: Live debug log viewer with filtering capabilities.
- **Models**: `Codable` structs that match the OpenAI API's JSON structure with full type safety.
