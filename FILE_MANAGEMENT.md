- Use descriptive names for your vector stores
- The AI will only search through files in the currently selected vector store
- Files must be successfully processed (status: "completed") before they can be searched

### API Integration

The app uses OpenAI's Files API and Vector Stores API to provide these features:

- Files are uploaded with the "assistants" purpose
- Vector stores are automatically configured for file search
- Tool resources are properly configured in chat requests when file search is enabled
