# Verbose Upload Logging & Progress UI

## 🎉 Feature Overview

This implementation adds **comprehensive logging** and **beautiful visual progress tracking** to the vector store file upload system. Every step of the upload process is now logged to the console with detailed information, and users get real-time visual feedback.

## ✨ What's New

### 1. **Visual Upload Progress UI** 📊

The upload view now transforms into a live progress tracker when files are being uploaded:

- **Overall Progress Bar** - Shows total completion (e.g., "Uploading 3 of 10 files")
- **Per-File Status Cards** - Each file gets its own status card with:
  - **Status Icon** - Clock (pending), upload arrow (uploading), gears (processing), checkmark (complete), or X (failed)
  - **Color Coding** - Gray → Blue → Purple → Green (or Red if failed)
  - **Status Text** - "Waiting...", "Uploading...", "Adding to vector store...", "Complete!", "Failed"
  - **Error Messages** - Inline error display if a file fails
  - **Spinner Animation** - Shows active progress during upload/processing

### 2. **Comprehensive Console Logging** 📝

Every operation is now logged with rich emoji icons and detailed information:

#### File Selection Phase
```
📁 User selected 3 file(s) for upload
   📄 document.pdf (2.4 MB)
   📄 notes.txt (45 KB)
   📄 report.docx (1.2 MB)
🎯 Target vector store: Research Documents (ID: vs_abc123)
⚙️ Using custom chunking: 1000 tokens with 200 overlap
```

#### Upload Phase (Per File)
```
📤 [1/3] Starting upload: document.pdf
   📖 Reading file data from: /path/to/document.pdf
   ✅ Read 2.4 MB from document.pdf
   ☁️ Uploading document.pdf to OpenAI API...
   🌐 Endpoint: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/files
   📋 Purpose: assistants
   📦 Boundary: 12345-abcde-67890
   ⏫ Sending 2.4 MB to OpenAI...
   📡 Response: HTTP 200
   ✅ File uploaded successfully! ID: file_xyz789, Size: 2.4 MB
```

#### Vector Store Addition Phase
```
🔗 Adding file to vector store
   📁 File ID: file_xyz789
   📦 Vector Store ID: vs_abc123
   🌐 Endpoint: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/vector_stores/vs_abc123/files
   ⚙️ Custom chunking strategy applied
      Type: static
      Max tokens: 1000
      Overlap: 200
   📤 Request body: {"file_id":"file_xyz789","chunking_strategy":{...}}
   ⏫ Sending request to OpenAI...
   📡 Response: HTTP 200
   ✅ File successfully added to vector store!
   📊 Status: in_progress
   📈 Usage bytes: 0
   📥 Full response: {...}
🎉 [1/3] Successfully processed: document.pdf
```

#### Completion Summary
```
🏁 Upload batch complete: 10 succeeded, 0 failed
✅ Dismissing upload view - at least one file succeeded
```

#### Error Handling
```
❌ [2/3] Failed to upload 'corrupted.pdf': File is corrupted
   Error details: NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=123
⚠️ All files failed - keeping upload view open
```

### 3. **Enhanced Error Resilience** 💪

- **Continue on Error** - If one file fails, the upload continues with remaining files
- **Detailed Error Messages** - Both in UI and console with full error details
- **Success Threshold** - View dismisses if at least one file succeeds
- **Failed Files Highlighted** - Red icons and error messages in the progress view

### 4. **Security-Scoped Resource Logging** 🔐

```
🔓 Released security-scoped resource for: document.pdf
```

Each file's security-scoped access is logged for transparency.

## 🎨 Visual States

### Status Icons & Colors

| Status | Icon | Color | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| **Pending** | `clock` | Gray | File is waiting to be processed |
| **Uploading** | `arrow.up.circle.fill` | Blue | File is being uploaded to OpenAI |
| **Processing** | `gearshape.2.fill` | Purple | File is being added to vector store |
| **Completed** | `checkmark.circle.fill` | Green | File successfully added |
| **Failed** | `xmark.circle.fill` | Red | File upload or processing failed |

1. **`VectorStoreSmartUploadView.swift`**
   - Added `UploadProgress` model with status enum
   - Added `uploadProgressView` with real-time progress UI
   - Added state variables: `isUploading`, `uploadProgress`, `currentFileIndex`, `totalFiles`
   - Completely rewrote `handleFileSelection()` with comprehensive logging
   - Added file-by-file error handling with continue-on-failure logic
   - Added 1.5 second delay before dismiss to show final state

2. **`OpenAIService.swift`**
   - Enhanced `uploadFile()` with detailed logging at every step
   - Enhanced `addFileToVectorStore()` with request/response logging
   - Added `formatBytes()` helper for readable file size display
   - Logs include: endpoint URLs, file IDs, chunking details, HTTP status codes, full response bodies

### New Model: `UploadProgress`

```swift
struct UploadProgress: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let filename: String
    var status: UploadStatus
    var fileId: String?
    var errorMessage: String?
    var fileSize: Int
    
    enum UploadStatus {
        case pending, uploading, processing, completed, failed
        // Includes icon, color, and description for each status
    }
}
```

## 🔍 How to Use

1. **Select Files** - Tap the purple vector store button in chat
2. **Watch Progress** - The view automatically switches to progress mode
