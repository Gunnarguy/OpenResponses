# Upload Summary Enhancement - Comprehensive API Metadata Display

## Overview
Enhanced the upload summary view to show **all available API metadata** from the OpenAI Vector Store File API, making the upload feedback "comprehensive and all encompassing" as requested.

## Problem Statement
The upload summary was showing basic information (filename, size, conversion status) but wasn't displaying detailed vector store metadata like:
- Storage usage (usage_bytes)
- Chunking strategy details
- Error details from vector store processing

User wanted to see "how many chunks and such... comprehensive and all encompassing" with "as much detail as the api offers."

## What Was Enhanced

### 1. **UploadResult Struct** - Added Rich Metadata Fields
```swift
struct UploadResult {
    // Original fields
    let originalFilename: String
    let finalFilename: String
    let fileId: String
    let fileSize: Int
    let wasConverted: Bool
    let conversionMethod: String
    let vectorStoreStatus: String?
    let success: Bool
    let errorMessage: String?
    
    // NEW: Enhanced vector store metadata
    let chunkCount: Int?              // Future-proofed for when API returns per-file chunks
    let usageBytes: Int?              // Storage used in vector store
    let chunkingStrategy: ChunkingStrategy?  // Chunking configuration details
    let lastErrorCode: String?        // Error code if vector store processing failed
    let lastErrorMessage: String?     // Detailed error message
}
```

### 2. **Data Capture** - Store Full VectorStoreFile Metadata
Updated `handleFileImporterResult` to capture the complete `VectorStoreFile` object:
```swift
let vectorStoreFile = try await api.addFileToVectorStore(vectorStoreId: vectorStoreId, fileId: uploadedFile.id)

uploadResults.append(UploadResult(
    // ... existing fields ...
    chunkCount: nil,  // Not available per-file in current API
    usageBytes: vectorStoreFile?.usageBytes,
    chunkingStrategy: vectorStoreFile?.chunkingStrategy,
    lastErrorCode: vectorStoreFile?.lastError?.code,
    lastErrorMessage: vectorStoreFile?.lastError?.message
))
```

### 3. **UploadSummary** - Total Vector Store Usage
Added computed properties to show aggregate vector store data:
```swift
struct UploadSummary {
    // ... existing properties ...
    
    var totalVectorStoreUsage: Int? {
        let usages = results.compactMap { $0.usageBytes }
        return usages.isEmpty ? nil : usages.reduce(0, +)
    }
    
    var hasVectorStoreData: Bool {
        results.contains { $0.usageBytes != nil }
    }
}
```

### 4. **UI Display** - Comprehensive Details

#### New Statistics Card
If any files have vector store metadata, a new stat card appears showing total storage usage:
```swift
UploadStatCard(
    icon: "externaldrive.fill",
    value: formatBytes(totalUsage),
    label: "Vector Storage",
    color: .indigo
)
```

#### Enhanced File Details (Expandable)
When expanding individual file rows, users now see:

**Storage Information:**
- "Storage Used: X KB" - Shows `usageBytes` from vector store

**Chunking Strategy:**
- For static chunking: "Chunking: 800 tokens max, 400 overlap"
- For auto chunking: "Chunking: Auto (default)"
- Shows the actual `ChunkingStrategy` configuration used

**Error Details (if failed):**
```
üü† Vector Store Error
[error_code] Detailed error message from API
```
Shows both `lastError.code` and `lastError.message` if vector store processing failed

## API Data Sources

### VectorStoreFile Object (from OpenAI API)
```json
{
  "id": "file_abc",
  "object": "vector_store.file",
  "usage_bytes": 1234,           // ‚úÖ Now displayed
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "vector_store_id": "vs_abc",
  "status": "completed",
  "last_error": {                // ‚úÖ Now displayed if present
    "code": "invalid_file",
    "message": "File format not supported"
  },
  "chunking_strategy": {         // ‚úÖ Now displayed
    "type": "static",
    "static": {
      "max_chunk_size_tokens": 800,
      "chunk_overlap_tokens": 400
    }
  }
}
```

### What's NOT Available Per-File
The API doesn't provide per-file chunk counts. The `file_counts` object is only available at the VectorStore level:
```json
{
  "vector_store": {
    "file_counts": {          // ‚ùå Not available per-file
      "completed": 15,
      "in_progress": 0,
      "failed": 0,
      "total": 15
    }
  }
}
```
We've future-proofed the struct with `chunkCount: Int?` in case OpenAI adds this in the future.

## User Experience

## Files Modified

### `/OpenResponses/Features/Chat/Components/FileManagerView.swift`
- **Lines 2646-2673**: Enhanced `UploadResult` struct with 5 new metadata fields
- **Lines 2674-2703**: Added `totalVectorStoreUsage` and `hasVectorStoreData` computed properties to `UploadSummary`
- **Lines 1010-1042**: Updated upload handler to capture full `VectorStoreFile` object
- **Lines 2740-2785**: Added Vector Storage stat card to summary view

## Benefits

### 1. **Complete Transparency**
Users now see every piece of data the API returns, meeting the "comprehensive and all encompassing" requirement.

### 2. **Debugging Aid**
Error codes and messages help users understand exactly what went wrong if vector store processing fails.

### 3. **Storage Awareness**
Users can see how much vector store quota they're consuming with each upload.

### 4. **Configuration Visibility**
Chunking strategy display helps users understand how their files are being processed.

### 5. **Future-Proof**
The `chunkCount` field is ready for when OpenAI adds per-file chunk reporting to the API.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload a file to vector store
- [ ] Verify upload summary appears with all stats
- [ ] Expand file details and verify:
  - [ ] Storage used displays (e.g., "123 KB")
  - [ ] Chunking strategy shows (e.g., "800 tokens max, 400 overlap")
  - [ ] If custom chunking was used, verify it displays correctly
- [ ] Upload multiple files and verify:
  - [ ] "Vector Storage" stat card appears
  - [ ] Total usage is correct sum
- [ ] Test with files that fail vector store processing:
  - [ ] Error code displays
  - [ ] Error message displays
  - [ ] Error icon and styling are appropriate
