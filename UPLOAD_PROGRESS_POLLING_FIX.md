# Upload Progress Polling Fix

## Problem Identified üêõ

After implementing the real-time upload progress overlay, files that required vector store processing would get stuck at 90% showing "Processing..." indefinitely. The upload summary would also show "Processing" status forever, even after the files had completed processing on the backend.

**Root Cause:**
- The `pollForFileCompletion` function was updating the vector store data when files completed
- BUT it wasn't updating the `currentUploadProgress` array that drives the progress overlay UI
- The overlay would stay at 90% until manually dismissed
- The main upload handler would immediately hide the overlay (`isUploading = false`) without waiting for processing to complete

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. Enhanced Polling Function with Progress Updates

Updated `pollForFileCompletion` to accept a `progressIndex` parameter and update the progress overlay in real-time:

```swift
@MainActor
private func pollForFileCompletion(
    vectorStoreId: String, 
    fileId: String, 
    progressIndex: Int,  // NEW: Index to update in progress array
    maxAttempts: Int = 30, 
    interval: TimeInterval = 2.0
) async {
    // ... polling logic ...
    
    if file.status == "completed" {
        // Update progress overlay to show completion
        if progressIndex < currentUploadProgress.count {
            currentUploadProgress[progressIndex].status = .completed
            currentUploadProgress[progressIndex].statusMessage = "Complete!"
            currentUploadProgress[progressIndex].progress = 1.0
        }
        // ... refresh UI ...
    } else if file.status == "failed" {
        // Update progress overlay to show failure
        if progressIndex < currentUploadProgress.count {
            currentUploadProgress[progressIndex].status = .failed
            currentUploadProgress[progressIndex].statusMessage = "Processing failed"
            currentUploadProgress[progressIndex].progress = 0.0
        }
        // ... refresh UI ...
    }
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Added `progressIndex: Int` parameter to track which file in the progress array to update
- On completion: Update status to `.completed`, progress to `1.0`, message to "Complete!"
- On failure: Update status to `.failed`, progress to `0.0`, message to "Processing failed"
- On timeout: Update status to `.completed` with message "Processing (check status)" so UI can proceed

### 2. Updated Polling Call with Index

Modified the upload handler to pass the current file index when starting polling:

```swift
Task {
    await pollForFileCompletion(
        vectorStoreId: vectorStoreId, 
        fileId: uploadedFile.id, 
        progressIndex: index  // Pass the current file index
    )
}
```

This allows the polling function to update the correct item in the `currentUploadProgress` array.

### 3. Wait for All Processing to Complete

Added logic to wait for all files to finish processing before hiding the overlay and showing the summary:

```swift
// Wait for all files to finish processing before showing summary
let hasProcessingFiles = currentUploadProgress.contains { $0.status == .processing }

if hasProcessingFiles {
    AppLogger.log("‚è≥ Waiting for X file(s) to finish processing...", category: .fileManager, level: .info)
    
    // Poll until all files are no longer in processing state
    while currentUploadProgress.contains(where: { $0.status == .processing }) {
        try? await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(1))
    }
    
    AppLogger.log("‚úÖ All files completed processing!", category: .fileManager, level: .info)
}

// NOW hide progress overlay (after all processing complete)
isUploading = false

// Show upload summary with final results
```

**Flow:**
1. Upload loop finishes adding files to vector store
2. Check if any files have `.processing` status
3. If yes, enter a polling loop checking every second
4. Wait until NO files have `.processing` status
5. Then hide overlay and show summary

## User Experience Improvements üéâ

### Before Fix ‚ùå
```
1. User uploads file
2. Progress shows: Converting ‚Üí Uploading ‚Üí Adding ‚Üí Processing (90%)
3. Progress STUCK at "Processing..." forever
4. Summary shows "Processing" status permanently
5. User has to close overlay manually
```

### After Fix ‚úÖ
```
1. User uploads file
2. Progress shows: Converting ‚Üí Uploading ‚Üí Adding ‚Üí Processing (90%)
3. Background polling updates progress in real-time
4. Progress automatically updates to "Complete!" (100%) when done
5. Overlay stays visible until ALL files complete
6. Overlay smoothly fades out
7. Summary automatically appears with accurate final status
```

## Technical Details üîß

### Async Coordination
- Main upload loop spawns background `Task` for each file that needs processing
- Background tasks poll every 2 seconds for up to 60 seconds (30 attempts √ó 2s)
- Each background task updates its corresponding index in the shared `currentUploadProgress` array
- Main thread waits for all processing tasks to complete before proceeding

### Thread Safety
- All UI updates marked with `@MainActor` to ensure main thread execution
- Progress array accessed safely with bounds checking
- State updates are atomic and coordinated through SwiftUI's binding system

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **Timeout**: If polling exceeds max attempts, mark as completed so UI can proceed
2. **File Not Found**: If file disappears from vector store, log warning and continue
3. **Network Errors**: Log errors but continue polling (transient issues)
4. **Multiple Files**: Wait for ALL files to complete before showing summary
5. **Failed Processing**: Show red X and "Processing failed" status

## Files Modified üìù

- `FileManagerView.swift`:
  - Enhanced `pollForFileCompletion` with progress updates (lines ~928-990)
  - Updated polling call to pass index (line ~1083)
  - Added wait logic before hiding overlay (lines ~1165-1180)
